receive,1,Our past is a series of lessons that advance us to higher levels of living and loving. The relationships we entered or ended taught us necessary lessons
receive,1,If your daily life seems poor  do not blame it  but rather  blame yourself and know that you have not been poetic enough to capture its richness.
receive,1,You were born with potential. You were born with goodness and trust. You were born with ideals. You were born with wings  so learn to use them and fly!
receive,1,God and men are like 2 lovers who have made a mistake on the location of their meeting place. Men waits for God in time and God waits for men in eternity.
receive,1,The happiness of ur life depends upon the quality of ur thoughts so guard accordingly and take care that u entertain no notions unsuitable to virtue.
receive,1,Be more concerned with ur character than with ur reputation. Ur character is what u really are while your reputation is merely what others think u are.
receive,1,Dont be afraid to fail or waste energy trying to cover up for it. Learn from it and go on to the next challenge. Its OK to fail. It helps you grow!
receive,1,Life should be measured not by the number of years but rather by the love shared  the memories made  the joy given and the blessings received.
receive,1,You can have anything u want if you want it desperately enough. U must want it with an inner exuberance that erupts through the skin and joins the energy.
receive,1,Life isnt about expecting and hoping  its about doing and becoming.Its about the choices uve made and the ones ure about to make.Pick wisely!
receive,1,Life is a great travel trip. The only problem is that it doesnt come with a map.We have to search for our own way to reach the destination.
receive,1,Its not the strongest of species that survives  nor the most intelligent but the one most responsive to change. Change is the rule of life!

receive,1,The most extraordinary thing about this life is that YOU are the author of your own destiny  and you get to decide whats in the next chapter.
receive,1,You can take from every experience what it has to offer you. And you cannot be defeated if you just keep taking one breath followed by another.
receive,1,There are some people who live in a dream world  and there are some who face reality and then there are those who turn one into the other.
receive,1,Real confidence comes from knowing and accepting yourself-your strengths and limitations  in contrast to depending on affirmation from others.

receive,1,Strength-Hard work spotlights the character of people: Some turn up their sleeves  some turn up their noses and some dont turn up at all.
receive,1,One who creates the opportunity is Brilliant. One who gets the opportunity is Lucky. One who capitalizes on the opportunity is the Winner.
receive,1,If you think youll lose  youll be lost; for out in the world we find success begins with a fellows will; its all in the state of mind!
receive,1,Past mistakes and failures are like stern and compelling schoolteachers  pushing you to work even harder for great scholarship and success.
